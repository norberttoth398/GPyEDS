# Data Sources for Examples

The files required to run the example scripts are hosted on Zenodo at https://zenodo.org/records/15256526

You will need to edit file names, directory stucture and code as appopriate. 

## Example 1: Building Hyperspectral cube

The file KRA13B_10mu_allphases.csv should be used as the example input file in place of example_data.csv in the example code. 

## Example 2: Segmentation and post-processing

The Montaged Map Data files will have to be placed in a folder to be read together using the code supplied.

## Example 3: EDS2CHEM

The all_qemscan_dict.pkl file can be read as shown in the code. The electron probe profiles are contained in Sample501_2_0_oxide.txt and can be read in from the code.
